## Security and Safety Requirements

Unattended operating power supplies are always a potential safety risk as short circuits or failures of power components can occur at any time, where even seemingly small power converters can cause fire or damage connected equipment.

- This development board has not been approved nor certified by the FCC and must not be used outside a professional laboratory environment
- Never operate the board unattended
- Only use power supplies delivered with the board or equal, approved laboratory equipment
- Read the user guide for detailed operating instructions to prevent damage to the board or connected equipment
